// BufferedBlockMgr is used to allocate and manage blocks of data using a fixed memory
// budget. Available memory is split into a pool of fixed-size memory buffers.
// When a client allocates or requests a block, the block is assigned a buffer from this
// pool and is 'pinned' in memory. Clients can also unpin a block, allowing the manager
// to reassign its buffer to a different block.
//
// BufferedBlockMgr reserves one buffer per disk ('block_write_threshold_') for itself.
// When the number of free buffers falls below 'block_write_threshold', unpinned blocks
// are persisted in Last-In_First-Out order. (It is assumed that unpinned blocks are
// re-read in FIFO order). TmpFileMgr is used to obtain file handles to write to within
// the tmp directories configured for Impala.
//
// A client must pin a block in memory to read/write its contents and unpin it
// when it is no longer in active use. BufferedBlockMgr guarantees that
// a) The memory buffer assigned to a block is not removed or released while it is pinned
// b) The contents of an unpinned block will be available on a subsequent call to pin.
//    Thus, an unpinned block must be persisted before its buffer is released or assigned
//    to a different block.
//
// The Client API is as follows:
// GetFreeBlock() returns a new pinned block. It waits if there are
//   no free buffers available.
// TryExpand() attempts a allocate a new buffer and assign it to a pinned block. If the
// memory limit is reached, TryExpand() returns immediately. It is non-blocking.
// A Block supports the following operations
// Pin(): Pins a block to a buffer in memory, and reads its contents from disk if
//   necessary. If there are no free buffers, waits for a buffer to become available.
//   Invoked before the contents of a block are read or written. The block
//   will be maintained in memory until Unpin() is called.
// Unpin(): Invoked to indicate the block is not in active use. The block is added to a
//   list of unpinned blocks. Unpinned blocks are only written when the number of free
//   blocks falls below the 'block_write_threshold'.
// Delete(): Invoked to deallocate a block. The buffer associated with the block is
//   immediately released and its on-disk location (if any) reused.
//
// Close() frees all memory and disk space and is called when a query is closed or
// cancelled. Close() is idempotent.
//
// The block manager is thread safe with the following caveat:
//   A single block cannot be pinned and used simultaneously by multiple clients.
// TODO: When a block is read from disk, data is copied from the IOMgr buffer to the
// block manager's buffer. This should be avoided in the common case where these buffers
// are of the same size.

  //   is valid on the block.

  // Pin() and Unpin() can be invoked on a block any number of times before Delete().
  // When a pinned block is unpinned for the first time, it is added to the
  // unpinned_blocks_ list and its buffer is removed from the free list.
  // If it is pinned or deleted at any time while it is on the unpinned list, it is
  // simply removed from that list. When it is dequeued from that list and enqueued
  // for writing, in_write_ is set to true. The block may be pinned, unpinned or deleted
  // while in_write_ is true. After the write has completed, the block's buffer will be
